# React Challenge
I did that task based on prepared [repository](https://git.jobsity.com/jobsity/ReactChallenge) in more-less 10 hours. Everything works but there is a lot of things that i can improve if
my time would be paid. 

In my app, you can add/modify/remove tasks to the calendar. Everything will be saved to local storage.  
You can also see the weather for the selected day of the task, but i used the free API with very few requests, so  
maybe it won't work, and you will see sunny weather because i set it as default.

## Things that i can improve here
- Use typescript
- Write e2e and unit tests
- Use styled components
- Create the best user experience / UX
- Create a standard component library
- Use paid weather API
- Use some API to get cities list
- Expand the functionality of this application and add new features

## How to deploy

 - Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
 - Run `npm start`   | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
 - You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.
